# package-starter-kit

Contains starter kit for my npm packages

package.json has common structure each project should have. Just replace **starter-kit** on valid package name. And you are ready to go ;)

Projects should be created according to these rules:

1. Project name should be kebab-cased.

Example:

**superDuperProject** - wrong variant.

**super-duper-project** - correct variant.

2. Each project should be written on TypeScript.

No exclusions here.

3. Each project should have tests with 100% coverage.

And no exclusions here. Cause - no tests - no code ;).
